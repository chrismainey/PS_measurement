## Workstream 1: Analysis of incident reporting data

## Using incident reporting data

### "Patient Safety I"

+ Harvard Medical Practice Study
+ IoM: To Err is Human
+ NHS: An Organisation with a Memory

> “Organisations should demonstrate that they have in place fully functional reporting systems for serious incidents, that staff know how to use them, that the systems are used, and that appropriate action is taken in response to incidents, including provision of appropriate support to the affected patients and their carers.” -Berwick, D (2013)

+ Clinical (qualitative review) is major method
+ Quantitative approaches being reduced deliberately

+ Finding relevant incidents is a key question
+ Natural Language Processing (NLP)

## Workstream 2: Measurement for the Patient Safety Improvement Programmes (SIPs)

.pull-left[
## QI & SIPs

+ Quality Improvement now established as a discipline, with it's methods: PDSA cycle & variations: (Lean / Six-sigma etc.) 

+ Difficult for analysts to appreciate differences in monitoring, improvement, assurance etc.

### Developmental:
+ Get experience in different areas to build your skills

+ Takes time to get experience, don't move too fast
{{content}}

--

+ Think about your skill set, and whether new skills will deliver better results

+ Remember it is about the message, despite the importance of detail

.pull-right[
### NHS Patient Safety:
+ Using incident reporting data to learn and build safer systems
  + Clinical review is bottle-neck
  + NLP methods can help provide targets
{{content}}
]

--
+ Measuring improvement is an imperfect thing:
  + Change over time or comparison against standards are main methods
  + Over-reliance on SPC or run-chart
  + All success is interpreted as due to programmes

--
+ __We can do better:__
  + Properly designed study conditions: e.g. stepped-wedge trials
  + Causal Inference
